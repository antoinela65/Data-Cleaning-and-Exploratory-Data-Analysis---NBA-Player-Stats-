**Features :**  

- Position-Based Analysis: Compared performance metrics such as PTS, AST, and TRB across different positions, identifying trends and insights based on player roles.
- High-Volume Shooters vs. Role Players: Assessed the efficiency of high-volume shooters compared to role players, with a focus on FG% and 3P%.
- Shooting Efficiency Analysis: Investigated the shooting percentages (FG%, 3P%, FT%) across different positions and analyzed the impact of minutes played on these metrics.
- Experience and Performance: Explored how age and experience affect performance metrics like points, assists, rebounds, and shooting percentages.
- Defensive Metrics Analysis: Analyzed players with the highest steals and blocks per game and compared defensive performance across different positions.

**Key Insights :**

- Shooting Efficiency: Certain positions like guards tend to have higher 3P% compared to big men, who often excel in FG%. Players with more minutes generally showed better     shooting percentages.
- High-Volume Shooters: High-volume shooters tend to have higher FG% and 3P% than role players, highlighting the impact of offensive responsibility on efficiency.
- Age and Performance: Younger players (18-24) showed moderate positive correlations between age and points, while older players (35-39) exhibited a negative correlation       with FG%.
- Defensive Analysis: Defensive performance varied significantly by position, with guards leading in steals and centers in blocks.
